## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **deep learning–based face detection system** using the **VGG16 model as a backbone**, enhanced with OpenCV utilities for visualization and I/O.

By leveraging a **convolutional neural network (CNN)**—specifically the popular **VGG16 architecture**, this system can detect faces with high accuracy in both images and live webcam feeds.

> ✅ This is a **deep learning project** because it utilizes a **pre-trained VGG16 network** to extract feature maps for identifying human faces in images or video streams.

## 🧠 Why Is This a Deep Learning Project?

- 🎯 Uses **VGG16**, a deep convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet.
- 📐 Learns spatial hierarchies of features useful for face detection.
- 🧠 Demonstrates the power of **transfer learning** and **deep feature extraction** for computer vision tasks.
- 🧪 Can be extended to face recognition, emotion detection, etc.
